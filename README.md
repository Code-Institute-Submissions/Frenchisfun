// Include image here! 

'French is fun' is a simple word matching game inspired by a real world word matching game that uses double sided magnets with the English
word on one side, the French word on the other. 
As someone learning the French langauge i wanted to develop a fun word matching game aimed at people that are at the 
early stages of learning French. The aim is Tr√®s facile! Simply match the English word to the corresponding French word! 
Try to match all the words before the time runs out! 

I wanted to create a fun game that also teaches basic vocabulary.

by those.

As a user: 

- I want to improve and increase my French vocabulary by using this app.  

Color: 

- I went with a mostly off-white color to contrast the colors of the buttons in their various states. 
- A light-ish purple color was was used for the border. 
- coolors.co was used to help create a balanced color scheme. 

Typography

I decided to use just one font, Comfortaa. I wanted a roundish font. 

Landing page:

- 'Welcome' modal appears on page load. This features an image which contains a colorful French illustration. 
- Validation text is in bold red which contrasts against the white background.
