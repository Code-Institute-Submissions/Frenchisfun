// Include image here! 

'French is fun' is a simple word matching game inspired by a real world word matching game that uses double sided magnets with the English
word on one side, the French word on the other. 
As someone learning the French langauge i wanted to develop a fun word matching game aimed at people that are at the 
early stages of learning French. The aim is Tr√®s facile! Simply match the English word to the corresponding French word! 
Try to match all the words before the time runs out! 

I wanted to create a fun game that also teaches basic vocabulary.
