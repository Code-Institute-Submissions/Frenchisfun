# French is fun - French / English word matching game

![readme image](/assets/images/readme_image.jpg)

A live demo can be found [here](https://jammerref2015.github.io/Frenchisfun/)


'French is fun' is a simple word matching game inspired by a real world word game **Kids 'French Kit by Magnetic Poetry** that uses double sided magnets with the English word on one side, the French word on the other.
As someone learning the French language I wanted to develop a fun word matching game aimed at people that are at the
early stages of learning French. The aim is Tr√®s facile! Simply match the English word to the corresponding French word!
Try to match all the words before the time runs out!

## UX

### Project Goals ###

The **goal** for this project is to make people was to make an easy to use word matching game to help increase vocabulary. I have been learning French for a while now and I have used a number of language learning applications in the past so I was inspired by those. The concept was to be kept simple along with the execution. 'French is fun' needed to be super easy to grasp.

- Wire frames for this project are available in the Mockups folder.

### User Goals ###

### Site Owner Goals ###

* As a **site owner**, I want to communicate my love for the French language by including images that highlight many French traditions.
* Matching games have been shown to provide the following benefits:
  * improve concentration
  * train visual memory
  * increase short term memory
  * increase attention to detail improve the ability to find similarities and differences in objects

* Buttons are clear and easy to read.
* It is clear when I have successfully completed the game.

### Design Choices ###
---
**Fonts**

I went with Google Fonts [Comfortaa](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Comfortaa:wght@500&family=Dosis&display=swap). I felt that this font had a certain friendliness to it.

**Colours**

- I went with a mostly off-white colour to contrast the colours of the buttons in their various states.
- A light-ish purple colour was used for the border.
- coolors.co was used to help create a balanced colour scheme.
- Images with a wide range of colours and a French theme.
- Validation text is in bold red which contrasts against the white background.
- Buttons are blue which contrasts nicely with the off-white background.
- Selected buttons are a grey colour.
- Successfully matched buttons turn green before fading out as a visual cue to the user that a match has been made.

* For some headers and titles: #F5F0F6 ![#F5F0F6](https://placehold.it/15/F5F0F6/000000?text=+) #F5F0F6
* For body background: #574D68 ![#574D68](https://placehold.it/15/#574D68/000000?text=+) #574D68
* For additional backgrounds:  #F5F0F6 ![#F5F0F6](https://placehold.it/15/#F5F0F6/000000?text=+) #F5F0F6


## Wireframing ##
---
For **wireframing** I used Balsamiq. This produced some **basic** wireframes, used to get an overall **feel** for what would go where and how things would look on different screen sizes.

In the early stage of the project the buttons were displayed on either side of the <textarea>'s'. Placing in on top and underneath worked better in regards to mobile design.


## Features ##
---
**Features** that have been **implemented:**

* Easy to use **navigation** on all screen sizes.
* Popup modals for starting the game, countdown running out and successfully completing the game.
* **Attractive** design aimed at ease of use.
* User can display a name.

**Features** that will be **implemented** in the **future:**

* The ability to change difficulty. Perhaps by making an adjustment to the countdown time. For example an easy difficulty level providing more time in which to complete the game.

* Turn the counter off. Learn on your time without the pressure of the timer.

* Multiple levels. Increasing in difficulty as the user progresses by means of including more difficult words. Counter continuing to countdown as they progress.

* Audio. Hear the word when a user clicks on a button. Also include some kind of sound on a successful match and/or successfully
completing a level.

* Different style of game such as including a series of words alongside an image. The user selects the correct word to match the image.

* Allow user to create a profile. This can include the ability to safe scores/times.

* Enable user to have a word list showing the words that they have learned.

* Dark mode feature.

* Allow user to change UI colours from included options.

## Testing

- The application was tested manually using the following browsers. Testing involved going through the steps listed below as well as checking for responsiveness.  
  - Chrome.
  - Firefox.
  - Microsoft Edge.
  - Safari.

- Mark-up was validated via https://validator.w3.org/ - no errors were found.
- CSS was validated via http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - no errors were found.
- JS was validated via https://jshint.com/ - no major issues found.


- Page loading speed was tested using via chrome Developer tools -> Network.
  - Finish: 2.34 s
  - DOMContentLoaded: 1.76 s


* The following steps were followed on all major browsers.

    - On page load:

    - Enter name modal:
        - Checked that 'welcome' modal appeared on page load.
        - Clicked on button to start game without entering a name. Validation appeared as intended.
        - Clicked outside the modal to make sure that user could not bypass modal without entering a name. Also pressed Esc.
        - Checked to insure that validation text appeared when text field was left blank.   
        - Entered a name in text field then clicked on button.  

    - Main game:
        - Checked to see that name entered in text field matches that which appears on screen.
        - Checked to see that counter was displayed and showed the correct timing.
        - Clicked on various buttons to make sure that the selected button changed colour.
          - Grey when selected.
          - Restored to blue when a different button in the same language group was selected.
          - On a successful match checked that buttons changed to green, faded out and became unselect-able.  
        - Let timer run down to ensure that the timer expired modal appeared and counter did not go in to minus.
          - Clicked outside the modal to make sure that user could not bypass modal. Also pressed Esc.
          - Checked that restart button reloaded the page.
        - Matched all buttons to ensure that a successfully completed modal appears and counter stops.
          - Clicked outside the modal to make sure that user could not bypass modal. Also pressed Esc.
          - Checked that restart button reloaded the page.

    - All of these actions were repeated with the console open. No errors were found.
    - The following bugs occurred during development

    - Counter issue:
      - Counter continued to run past zero even when user successfully completed the game.
    - Randomise feature:
      - Adding the randomise feature caused buttons to randomise on click as opposed to on page load.
    - Rows too close to each other:
      - Set margins and padding.
    - Enter name modal:
      - User able to bypass enter name modal by clicking outside the modal.
      - User able to begin game without entering a name.
    - Timer expired modal:
      - User able to bypass timer expired modal by clicking outside the modal.
      - User able to resize text-areas which affected the positioning of other elements.  
      - Styling was added to prevent this.
    - Modal images too large:
      - Added styling to the modals which fixed this.
    - Timer expired modal appearing on game completion:
      - Changes made to counter function to prevent this from happening.
    - User needs to enter name when restarting:
      - Need to implement something that would not require the same user to constantly re-enter their name.
    - Button sections styling issue.
      - Removing buttons resulted in rows getting smaller. Using a different technique to remove the buttons fixed this issue.

    - The following bugs were discovered upon validation/testing

    - 'Welcome' modal Firefox issue:
      - When clicking on button with a blank text field the validation text read 'Enter Nome'.
    - User name and counter was not visible when accessed on mobile without clicking on the accordion button:
      - Replaced navbar with a row with styling.
